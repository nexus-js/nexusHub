# Roadmap 
Potential roadmap for the development of Nexus

## Docs

[ ] document main commands for hub.js, browserHub.js, and maxHub.js
[ ] document typical usage/approaches


## hub.js

[ ] Rooms for group and user collections
[ ] file asset upload and sharing
[ ] auto populate folders of sounds
[ ] recording from device or application to shared asset folder
[ ] Channels not explicitly (over)written automatically send based on the toWhom array
[ ] create catch-all socket.on function that simply mirrors out any information received on the specified transmit channels.
[ ] instantiate SocketIO in Hub.prototype.init instead of node file. 

## browserHub.js

## maxHub.js

[ ] tidy up the basic Max 7 interface utilities
-- json to and from max lists
-- Automatic destination (toWhom)
-- specifyable destination (toWhom)
[ ] Move on to greater things...
