# Docker deployment

Docker makes deployment much easier but now does not require it

### Less control - faster

* hyper.sh
  * [Hyper.sh - On-demand Container, Per-Second Billing](https://hyper.sh/)
  * only for Docker deployments
* now.sh
  * [Now – Realtime Global Deployments](https://zeit.co/now)
  * Docker and node

### More control - higher barrier to entry

* Google Cloud
  * [Google Kubernetes Engine  |  Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)
* AWS
  * [Amazon ECS - run containerized applications in production](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)
